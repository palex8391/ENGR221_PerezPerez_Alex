Description: Game data for the snake game. This program is a simple snake game where the player controls
as snake that moves around the board, eating food and growing in length. The game ends when the snake
collides with itself or the walls of the board. The player can also choose to let the AI control the snake, 
which uses it to search the nearest duck.
